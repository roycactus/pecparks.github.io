Its European origins date back to the Loyalists who settled here in the last part of the 1700s after fleeing the United States following the Revolution. Prior to the arrival of the Loyalists, it was an important hunting, fishing, and water route for the Mohawk nation.\n\nThe first burial was in 1812, a Levi B. son of John and Mary, with no recorded last name. The next burials were William Carter Allison and Ensign John Babcock in 1817, then Elizabeth Peack in 1825. Officially the Cemetery came into being with the gift of land in 1825 by the Peacks (Pecks) from their homestead on Lot 93. Family legend says it was Grandma Elizabeth who made the gift, which may be so because it was not completed until after her death, mostly likely by her husband James (Jacobus), and it certainly doesn't explain the burials prior to 1825.

Barker constructed the two storey frame house in 1812, within an area which gradually transformed into a business/commercial district, eventually overtaking the residential area. The relocation of Barker House in 1900, which accommodated the Picton Post Office until 1872, to make way for the new post office when the Main Street frontage was sold to Federal Government provides a tangible link to the development of Picton. Further, the donation of the relocated house and remnant grounds to the Town of Picton in 1945 by canning magnate W. H. Benson for public use reinforces the connection to town history. The site, building and the Barker family are intertwined with the history of Picton. \n\nThe building and grounds are an integral part of the town center, and Benson Hall and park are considered local landmarks. Benson Park was the first formal park of the town and provides an important central green space linking the residential and business communities. The distinct location of Benson Hall as setback from the common building line of King Street and the enclosure of the park by buildings and trees, together create a unique and attractive urban space and the total site contributes considerably to the neighbourhood and town character.

Often thought to have no visible source of water, it is actually fed by at least two small streams from the surrounding higher land, predominantly from the west but another enters near the southeast corner. The southeast supply is more of a seasonal spring runoff and by summer is sometimes completely dry. There is also a significant area of swamp to the southwest which would act as a reservoir for water that would eventually flow into the lake. Drainage of the lake occurs on the east side where a small stream flows down the cliff into Lake Ontario's Bay of Quinte. It is believed to be a collapsed doline (a type of sinkhole).

Seven hundred and one acres of land on the outskirts of Picton became the home of the Royal Air Force (RAF) where many young British, Canadian and American men trained as combat pilots. After World War II, the site was used as a storage and equipment maintenance centre for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Later, the Royal Canadian School of Artillery (anti-aircraft) took over the site. The school provided training for anti-aircraft gunners, gunnery radar operators, technical assistants and artillery instructors. By the 1950’s, the base was expanded. In the early ‘60’s , the first battalion Canadian Guards, an infantry unit, settled into the camp and became a respected addition to the community and in 1966, were granted the “Freedom of the City”, the highest honour a civilian community can give a military unit. Throughout its military history, the site also housed the AVRO Arrow test models.\n \nIn 1969, the Department of Defense pulled out of CFB Picton and shortly thereafter the aerodrome and the original BCATP buildings were purchased by the H.J. McFarland Company. The current company purchased Loch-Sloy Holdings Limited from the McFarland family in 1999. By that time, the site had been greatly vandalized and had very little activity occurring in the now industrial site. \n \nThe current company works diligently to preserve this former World War II air training base. A historical note worth mentioning is that this former BCATP base is the last remaining site of its kind in North America, and possibly the world, with as many original buildings still intact. It is a Canadian historical treasure worth preserving.","url":"Loch Sloy\nhttps://loch-sloy.webnode.com/","img":null,"note":null,"active":true,"type":"Parcel","area":100096,"restoom":false,"park":false,"picnic":false,"playground":false,"beach":false,"splashpad":false,"dogpark":false,"hike":false,"cycle":false,"launch":false,"dock":false,"fish":false,"canoe":false,"historic":true,"heritage":false,"cons":false,"library":false,"museum":true,"cemetery":false,"lighthouse":false,"dam":false,"skateboard":false,"tennis":false,"soccer":false,"baseball":false,"basketball":false,"skate":false,"ski":false,"toboggan":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.13886882528632,43.98891049350163]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":162,"visited":false,"name":"Picton Branch Library","ward":"Picton","address":"208 Picton Main St","ownerType":"Municipal","owner":"Prince Edward County","summary":"On March 12, 1846, a charter was obtained for a Mechanic’s Institute in the Town of Picton, which functioned intermittently until 1890 when a meeting was called to establish a full-­fledged library.

The placement of the house and barn, and of hedgerows and windbreaks, indicate a planned architectural design intent.","url":"Record of Designation\nhttps://maps.thecounty.ca/pecountyext/rest/services/PEC_PublicViewerDynamic/MapServer/59/400/attachments/121","img":null,"note":"3141-2012","active":true,"type":"Building","area":null,"restoom":false,"park":false,"picnic":false,"playground":false,"beach":false,"splashpad":false,"dogpark":false,"hike":false,"cycle":false,"launch":false,"dock":false,"fish":false,"canoe":false,"historic":true,"heritage":false,"cons":false,"library":false,"museum":false,"cemetery":false,"lighthouse":false,"dam":false,"skateboard":false,"tennis":false,"soccer":false,"baseball":false,"basketball":false,"skate":false,"ski":false,"toboggan":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.09761533618685,43.89949284932935]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":9842,"visited":false,"name":"Ross Cemetery (Wright/Carson)","ward":"North Marysburgh","address":"370 Kaiser Cross Rd","ownerType":"Private","owner":"Davis Marion","summary":null,"url":null,"img":null,"note":"62","active":true,"type":"Other","area":914,"restoom":false,"park":false,"picnic":false,"playground":false,"beach":false,"splashpad":false,"dogpark":false,"hike":false,"cycle":false,"launch":false,"dock":false,"fish":false,"canoe":false,"historic":false,"heritage":false,"cons":false,"library":false,"museum":false,"cemetery":true,"lighthouse":false,"dam":false,"skateboard":false,"tennis":false,"soccer":false,"baseball":false,"basketball":false,"skate":false,"ski":false,"toboggan":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.89333307224594,44.0655776314583]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":172,"visited":false,"name":"Rossmore Park","ward":"Ameliasburgh","address":"County Rd 28","ownerType":"Municipal","owner":"Prince Edward County","summary":null,"url":null,"img":null,"note":null,"active":true,"type":"Parcel","area":21165,"restoom":true,"park":false,"picnic":true,"playground":true,"beach":false,"splashpad":false,"dogpark":false,"hike":true,"cycle":false,"launch":false,"dock":false,"fish":false,"canoe":false,"historic":false,"heritage":false,"cons":false,"library":false,"museum":false,"cemetery":false,"lighthouse":false,"dam":false,"skateboard":true,"tennis":false,"soccer":false,"baseball":false,"basketball":true,"skate":false,"ski":false,"toboggan":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.38598285539885,44.13642432452213]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":174,"visited":false,"name":"Rotary Park Fawcettville","ward":"Picton","address":"28 Fawcett Ave","ownerType":"Municipal","owner":"Prince Edward County","summary":"Amenities: picnic table, large green space, playground equipment (jungle gym and swings), baseball backstop","url":null,"img":null,"note":null,"active":true,"type":"Parcel","area":3325,"restoom":true,"park":true,"picnic":true,"playground":true,"beach":false,"splashpad":false,"dogpark":false,"hike":false,"cycle":false,"launch":false,"dock":false,"fish":false,"canoe":false,"historic":false,"heritage":false,"cons":false,"library":false,"museum":false,"cemetery":false,"lighthouse":false,"dam":false,"skateboard":false,"tennis":false,"soccer":false,"baseball":true,"basketball":false,"skate":false,"ski":false,"toboggan":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.13696451366498,44.02197459183399]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":173,"visited":false,"name":"Rotary Park Ontario Street","ward":"Picton","address":"3 Ontario St","ownerType":"Municipal","owner":"Prince Edward County","summary":null,"url":null,"img":null,"note":null,"active":true,"type":"Parcel","area":3474,"restoom":false,"park":false,"picnic":true,"playground":true,"beach":false,"splashpad":false,"dogpark":false,"hike":false,"cycle":false,"launch":false,"dock":false,"fish":false,"canoe":false,"historic":false,"heritage":false,"cons":false,"library":false,"museum":false,"cemetery":false,"lighthouse":false,"dam":false,"skateboard":false,"tennis":false,"soccer":false,"baseball":false,"basketball":true,"skate":false,"ski":false,"toboggan":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.14773861972182,44.002770166650706]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":259,"visited":false,"name":"Royal Canadian Legion","ward":"Picton","address":"347 Main St","ownerType":"Private","owner":"Canadian Legion Branch 78","summary":"The commanding presence of the central pavilion (whose prestigious interior once matched the gradeur of the exterior) was emphasized by large triple-stacked chimneys;
